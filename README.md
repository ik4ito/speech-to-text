# speech-to-text
Speech to text web application that uses php to store the values into a database.

This web application uses webkitSpeechRecognition and PHP to log the output.

When you press the STOP button, an HTTP request sends the value of the output to a database. 
I added a message to let you know what has been stored.

and if we check the database, we can see it has been stored successfully
